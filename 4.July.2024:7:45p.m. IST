Given a binary tree, your task is to find all duplicate subtrees from the given binary tree.

Duplicate Subtree : Two trees are duplicates if they have the same structure with the same node values.

Note:  Return the root of each tree in the form of a list array & the driver code will print the tree in pre-order tree traversal in lexicographically increasing order.

Examples:

Input : 
 
Output: 2 4   
        4
Explanation: The above tree have two duplicate subtrees.i.e 
  2
 /
4  and 4. Therefore, you need to return the above tree root in the form of a list.
